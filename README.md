# Image-Classification
Image Classification with TensorFlow and Keras
This is a simple image classification project using TensorFlow and Keras. The project demonstrates how to build a neural network model to classify images into predefined categories or classes. In this example, we'll classify images as "Cat" or "Dog," but you can adapt the project to your own classification task.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset of cat and dog images. You can replace this with your own dataset.
- `image_classification.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that walks through the entire image classification process using TensorFlow and Keras. You can follow the steps in this notebook to understand the code and the model.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python packages and dependencies required to run the project. You can install these dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Getting Started

 Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classification.git

Open and run the image_classification.ipynb notebook to see how the image classification model is built and trained.

Replace the data/ directory with your own dataset if you have one.

Customize the model, training parameters, and dataset as needed for your image classification task.
